### More Information

As a cloud consultant, I help business to innovate and to improve their competitiveness by bringing a holistic approach in the digital transformation adoption.

I have a proven track record in cloud computing architectures, unified communications, monitoring solutions, infrastructure as code and CICD strategies implementation for micro services stacks. I am a collaborative team player who works diligently to ensure projects are completed efficiently and accurately.

Building applications for the cloud is more than just learning a new set of technologies or a new programming language. It involves continually seeking out new ways to expand my knowledge and abilities. I am looking forward for Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect certification and consolidating Big Data solutions and platforms skills.
